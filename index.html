      <h2>Lexington by its Numbers in 2025</h2>
      <p>
        Lexington is mostly described through its history, its schools,
        Minuteman bikeway, MassAve and its coffee shops.
      </p>

      <p>
        Behind every number here is a person who we share our town with - our
        neighbor, our child's classmate, a familiar voice at the town meeting,
        our friend and the family down the street who turns on their porch light
        at night.
      </p>
      <p>
        This article is an attempt to describe Lexington through its numbers -
        what its population looks like, how it works, and where it lives.
      </p>
      <div class="charts">
        <h3 style="text-align: center">
          Total Population Broken Down by Gender
        </h3>
        <svg
          id="chart1"
          aria-label="Voronoi treemap showing total population by gender"
        ></svg>
        <p>
          The split between males and females is almost even close to a 50-50
          balance suggesting that the town's demographic structure is healthy.
          This indicates a balanced mix of household and a stable school
          population.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">
          Total Population broken down by age group
        </h3>
        <svg
          id="chart2"
          aria-label="Voronoi treemap showing total population by age group"
        ></svg>
        <p>
          The largest sector belongs to people between 45 to 54 years old. This
          reveals a strong presence of households raising childrens. The next
          largest sector is that of people between 65-74 years old which
          suggests that people prefer to age in palce and may be long term home
          owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 20 to 24 years old is the smallest segment suggesting that people
          tend to move away for education and early career opportunities
          probably returning later in life to establish families of their own.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">
          Total Working Population broken down by income
        </h3>
        <svg
          id="chart32"
          aria-label="Voronoi treemap showing total working population by income"
        ></svg>
        <p>
          The most important insight to draw from this chart is that 56% of
          working population earns $200k or more. Thus the majority of
          households are clustered at the very top of the income bracket. This
          economic layer is well above the national and state averages. This
          proportion of people earning between $150k to $200k and $100k to $150k
          is also sizable.
        </p>
        <p>
          This distribution can typically correlate with high home values and a
          strong local economy.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">Population broken down by Race</h3>
        <svg
          id="chart6"
          aria-label="Voronoi treemap showing population by race"
        ></svg>
        <p>
          The two largest groups are by far the Whites and Asians. Whites are a
          reflective of historically white New England subarbs. But the size of
          Asian population is particularly notable - it also forms a major
          demographic pillar of the town.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also states that the black representation is relatively smaller
          even below the state averages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two or more races category is also not negligible. This indicates
          intergenerational diversity, generational blending and an evolution
          beyond single category indetity.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">Total Housing Units</h3>
        <svg
          id="chart42"
          aria-label="Voronoi Treemap showing total housing units"
        ></svg>
        <p>
          The town primarily favours stand alone houses. This aligns strongly
          with home owners being long-term.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though there are many apartment or multi-unit dwellings, they are
          not very common. This suggests that entry level housing stock is
          constrained and the density seems to be relatively low compared to
          other urban areas.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">
          Working Population broken down by Industry
        </h3>
        <svg
          id="chart5"
          aria-label="Voronoi treemap showing working population by industry"
        ></svg>
        <p>
          Lexington is a knowledge economy town with the two largest secotrs
          alone forming the working economy of the town outpacing the
          traditional industries such as contruction, retail and manufacturing.
          This distribution suggests that the professional community is closely
          tied to Boston's innovation, healthcare and education sectors. Most
          people are likely to travel to downtown for work.
        </p>
        <p>
          All these numbers taken together sketch a picture of Lexington as a
          prosperous, knowledge-driven community with a strong emphasis on
          long-term homeownership and a high standard of living.
